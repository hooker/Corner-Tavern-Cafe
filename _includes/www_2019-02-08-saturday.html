    Wigle Distillery is a family owned grain-to-bottle distillery named
    after Phillip Wigle. Wigle, a PA distilling pioneer, defended his
    right to distill in a tussle with a tax collector and unwittingly
    helped spark the Whiskey Rebellion, which pitted Western
    Pennsylvania distillers against George Washington's troops. He was
    sentenced to hang for treason but was ultimately pardoned by
    Washington.

    Ragged Branch is a grain-to-bottle distillery in Charlottesville VA.
    Ragged Branch and Whistle Pig share the same master distiller, Dave
    Pickerell, who recently passed in November of 2018. Unlike Whistle
    Pig, Ragged Branch gave Pickerell the resources to distill all
    spirits, rather than source whiskeys as Whistle Pig does.
